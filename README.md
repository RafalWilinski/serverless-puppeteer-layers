> Recently AWS introduced [Layers](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-lambda-now-supports-custom-runtimes-and-layers/) which enables sharing common code between functions and working with large dependencies (such as headless chrome) much easier.

This project example returns a screenshot of page requested via `?address=` query parameter.

### Usage

_Note_: this project uses `puppeteer-core` package rather than the standard `puppeteer` one. This is done in order to keep the function size in check - without this, your function size would be more than 200MB which is way too much. The difference between the two is [explained here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteer-vs-puppeteer-core).

Install the project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.

After that, you can simply deploy your function.

```sh
sls deploy

curl <DEPLOYED_ENDPOINT>?address=https://google.com
```

or apply this ARN to your function directly: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:085108115628:layer:chrome:6`
